                    <p>Geothermal energy is the heat derived from the Earth's interior, a resource that originates from both the planet's primordial formation and the continuous radioactive decay of elements within its crust and mantle. 
                       This energy manifests at the surface in forms such as volcanoes, hot springs, geysers, and steam vents. The temperature beneath Earth's surface typically increases with depth, providing a vast, largely untapped store of renewable energy.
                        </p>
                    <p><br />The importance of geothermal energy lies in its capacity to provide continuous, stable, and renewable energy with minimal environmental impact. 
                        Unlike solar or wind energy, which are intermittent, geothermal energy offers reliable baseload power and heating solutions, producing less greenhouse gas emissions than traditional fossil fuels. 
                        Its deployment supports global efforts to limit air pollution and combat climate change, aligning with green and clean energy transitions.</p>

                    <p><br /><b>Around the world, geothermal energy supports a variety of applications including:</b>
                             <li>Electricity generation (geothermal power plants)</li>
                            <li>Direct heating (homes, greenhouses, fisheries, district heating)</li>
                            <li>Industrial processes (drying crops, milk pasteurization, industrial heat)</li>
                            <li>Spa and recreational uses</li>
                            </p>

                    <p>Geothermal energy's importance in green energy portfolios is heightened by its low carbon footprint, reliable availability, and minimal land use compared to other renewables. 
                        As nations intensify their clean energy transitions, geothermal is being increasingly recognized as pivotal for both electricity generation and direct heat applications.
                        </p>
                        <br><p>Despite global advances, Sri Lanka's geothermal potential remains largely unexplored. 
                        Some preliminary surveys have identified promising sites, including thermal springs and geological formations along specific belts 
                        (such as Trincomalee-Ussangoda, Polonnaruwa, Udawalawe, Galwewa, Mahalenessa, and Monaragala), 
                        where ground heat sources may be suitable for power generation or industrial use. 
                        Given Sri Lanka's increasing energy demand and the need to diversify its energy mix away from fossil fuels, 
                        investigating the potential use cases of geothermal energy—especially for societal progress and industrial advancement—is both timely and highly relevant. 
                        This study aims to systematically evaluate geothermal resources, assess viable applications, and chart pathways for Sri Lanka to harness geothermal energy to benefit society and drive industrial growth.

        <h1 class="title">Geothermal Energy in Sri Lanka</h1>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>Geothermal energy is the thermal energy generated and stored within the Earth. 
                        This energy results from primordial heat from planetary formation as well as ongoing radioactive decay in the Earth’s mantle and crust. 
                        While traditional geothermal exploration targets volcanic regions where hot springs and steam vents mark obvious thermal activity, 
                        recent years have witnessed significant advances in non-volcanic (metamorphic) terrains—including Sri Lanka.
                        </p>
                    <p><br />Metamorphic terrains, like those covering Sri Lanka, present unique geothermal opportunities. 
                        These terrains are distinguished by faults, folds, shear zones, and igneous intrusions (such as dolerite dykes), which create complex fluid pathways. 
                        These subsurface structures enable meteoric waters to circulate deep underground, become heated, and return to the surface as thermal springs. 
                        The natural fractures and mineralized zones (enriched in magnetite, ilmenite, hematite, and other ferromagnetic minerals) provide distinctive geophysical 
                        signatures for detection and resource assessment.</p>

                    <p><br />Ground magnetic surveys, as demonstrated in the recent Wahawa–Padiyathalawa study, have become increasingly important for mapping structural features,
                         identifying fluid conduits, and delineating underlying heat sources in such settings. 
                         Advanced magnetic data processing—using filters like Reduction to Equator (RTE), Tilt Horizontal Derivative (THDR), 
                         and pseudo-gravity transformations—reveal subsurface lineaments and the relationships between geological structures and thermal discharges.</p>

                    <p><br />Globally, geothermal energy is essential for clean, stable base-load electricity generation and direct heating. 
                        Countries such as Iceland, the USA, Kenya, the Philippines, and Indonesia have developed vast geothermal infrastructure for power, heat, agriculture, 
                        and industry, often situated in tectonic or volcanic zones.</p>

                    <p><br /><b>Key scientific findings in Sri Lanka’s context:</b>
                             <li>Sri Lanka’s geothermal systems are “low enthalpy” (source temperatures <150°C) and primarily distributed in high-grade metamorphic terrains, not volcanic regions.</li>
                            <li>The geothermal gradient (rate of temperature increase with depth) along ancient thrust zones is steeper than in average continental crust.</li>
                            <li>Numerous studies propose different formation mechanisms: heat-producing granites, magmatic fluid upwelling, serpentinization, uranium decay, dolerite dyke residual heat, and the role of intersecting faults.</li>
                            <li>The most promising use cases locally focus on direct-use (agriculture, bathing, spas, industrial heat) and, with further development, electricity generation.</li>

                    <p><br />All springs are classified as low enthalpy systems, with discharge temperatures typically ranging between 34°C and 73.5°C. 
                        None have yet proven steam-generation temperatures for large-scale electricity, but several are suitable for direct-use energy and small-scale 
                        generation with enhanced methods.</p>

                             <li>Springs are aligned predominantly along lithological boundaries—especially the Highland–Vijayan Complex boundary and deep fracture zones.</li>
                            <li>Dolerite dykes act as either residual heat sources or impermeable barriers, depending on local geology.</li>
                            <li>Several formations may also overlap with heat-producing granites and serpentinization zones.</li>

        <h1 class="title">Objective</h1>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>The primary objective of this study is to compare the enthalpy values of geothermal resources in Sri Lanka with those of internationally recognized 
                        geothermal systems that are already being utilized for industrial and communal purposes. This research seeks to establish how the thermal characteristics 
                        (enthalpy/temperature profiles) of Sri Lankan geothermal springs—predominantly low-enthalpy systems—align with or differ from global benchmarks such as 
                        those in Iceland, the United States, Indonesia, and Kenya, where medium- to high-enthalpy resources are harnessed for power generation, district heating, 
                        and direct-use industrial processes.</p>
                    <p><br />Based on this comparative analysis, the study will scientifically determine the potential uses of selected Sri Lankan geothermal resources, 
                        focusing on their viability for local industrial applications (e.g. food processing, drying, aquaculture), community services (e.g. bathing, spas, 
                        heating), and future prospects for scalable energy generation within Sri Lanka’s broader energy mix. The ultimate goal is to provide evidence-based 
                        recommendations for the optimal utilization of Sri Lanka’s geothermal energy in alignment with global best practices, technological feasibility, and
                         sustainable development objectives.</p>

                 <h1 class="title">Study Area</h1>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>The study area encompasses the principal geothermal spring zones within Sri Lanka's eastern and southeastern metamorphic terrains, 
                        specifically focusing on regions such as Kanniyai (Trincomalee), Nelumwewa (Dimbulagala), Kapurella (Mahiyangana), Wahawa–Padiyathalawa, Maha Oya, 
                        Mahapelessa (Hambantota), Maduru Oya, Rankihiriya, and Jayanthiwewa. These geothermal sites are collectively aligned along the boundary between the 
                        Highland and Vijayan Complexes, where ancient thrusts, faults, and dolerite dyke intrusions create favorable geology for subsurface heat flow and
                         hydrothermal activity.</p>
                    <p><br />The selected locations represent the full spectrum of Sri Lanka’s low-enthalpy geothermal resources, exhibiting discharge temperatures 
                        typically ranging from 34°C to 73°C. Structurally, the area is defined by complex folding, chaining of anticlines and synclines, major NE-SW 
                        trending faults, and a network of surface fractures. These features both localize and control geothermal manifestations, making the region ideal for 
                        comparative analysis against globally recognized geothermal systems. The study integrates geophysical magnetic survey data, hydrogeological field 
                        records, and previously published chemical and isotopic analyses to evaluate potential industrial and communal uses, as well as the prospects for future 
                        resource development.</p>

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>A preliminary desk study was carried out using data analytics tools in combination with geological maps, satellite imagery, 
                        and Google Earth datasets to evaluate the surface geology of Sri Lanka's principal geothermal spring regions. This initial phase focused on 
                        identifying lithological boundaries, intrusive dolerite dykes, and key structural features—including faults, fractures, shear zones, and ancient thrust 
                        boundaries—which are recognized as critical controls on geothermal fluid circulation in the country’s high-grade metamorphic terrains. 
                        Localized geological mapping was conducted to verify and refine interpretations of surface features.</p>
                    <p><br />All geological and geophysical data were integrated with published hydrochemical and isotopic analyses of spring waters, enabling a multidisciplinary 
                        assessment of heat sources, fluid pathways, and enthalpy values. Comparative analysis was then performed against internationally benchmarked geothermal 
                        resources, focusing on temperature profiles, structural context, and technological feasibility for direct and industrial uses. The methodology ensures a
